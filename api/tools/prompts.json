Yes/No question: Output \"1\" if the question requires a yes or no answer.\n 2. How many question: Output \"2\" if the question asks for a numerical quantity or count.\n 3. Multiple choice question: Output \"3\" if the question provides multiple answer options.\n Strictly follow these guidelines and output only the corresponding number (1, 2, or 3) based on the question's type.",
