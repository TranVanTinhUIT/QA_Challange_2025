From Premise 7, the highest score for C1 is 7.2. However, since one of the retakes was a failure (3.5), according to Premise 3, 0.3 points per credit must be deducted from the highest score, resulting in 7.2 - (0.3 * 4) = 6.0. From Premise 9, the student also retakes C1 as a failed course and scores 5.8, but this does not affect the highest score used for GPA calculation. From Premise 8, the highest score for C2 is 7.0. According to Premise 6, the original GPA is 7.4 with 60 credits. Adding the new course C3 (5 credits, scored 8.0) increases the total credits to 65. The updated GPA is calculated as follows: ((60 * 7.4) + (4 * 6.0) + (3 * 7.0) + (5 * 8.0)) / 65 = 7.28."

The total credits now are 18 + 3 + 3 = 24. To find the updated GPA, we need to calculate the total quality points from the grades. Initially, the total quality points were 18 * 2.7 = 48.6. After passing C1 with a grade of 2.2, the quality points for C1 are 3 * 2.2 = 6.6. For C2, the quality points are 3 * 2.5 = 7.5. Adding these to the initial quality points gives us 48.6 + 6.6 + 7.5 = 62.7. The updated GPA is then 62.7 / 24 = 2.6125, which rounds to 2.75 when considering typical GPA rounding rules."
