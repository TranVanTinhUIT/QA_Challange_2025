From premise 14, third-year students can apply for study abroad if they meet the foreign language standard for year three (∀s (ThirdYear(s) ∧ MeetsLanguageStandard(s, YearThree) → EligibleStudyAbroad(s))). From premise 1, students are ranked as third-year if their accumulated credits are between 2M and 3M and they meet the language standard (∀s (ThirdYear(s) ↔ ((2M ≤ AccumulatedCredits(s) < 3M) ∧ MeetsLanguageStandard(s, YearThree)))). From premise 2, the average credits per year (M) for regular students is 33 (M = 33). Since premise 3 states that Phong has accumulated 70 credits, which is between 66 and 99, and he has met the language standard, premise 1's condition is satisfied, so Phong is a third-year student. Since premise 3 states that Phong has met the language standard, premise 14's conditions are met.

Since there exists at least one transparent blockchain network (Premise 13), this means there exists at least one scalable blockchain network.\n- However, to determine if ALL blockchain networks are scalable, we need to consider the implications of transparency and scalability for all blockchain networks.\n- From Premise 12, if a blockchain network is not scalable, then it does not adhere to regulatory standards. But since all blockchain networks are robust (Premise 5) and robustness is implied by adherence to regulatory standards (Premise 1), this suggests that no blockchain network can fail to be scalable without contradicting the robustness condition.\n- Therefore, since all blockchain networks must adhere to regulatory standards to be robust, and transparency leads to scalability, and all networks are secure and thus must adhere to regulatory standards, it follows that all blockchain networks must be scalable.\n\nThus, the answer is Yes, all blockchain networks are scalable."
