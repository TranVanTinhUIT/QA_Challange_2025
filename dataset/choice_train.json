Let’s check a device with a motion sensor—say, device X. Since it has a motion sensor, Premise 1 says it’s compatible with apps. Then, because it’s compatible with apps, Premise 2 says it’s energy efficient. So, any device with a motion sensor ends up being energy efficient, which matches option B: all devices with motion sensors are energy efficient. Option A is incorrect because Premise 2 says all app-compatible devices are energy efficient, so none can be compatible but not energy efficient. Option C is incorrect because a device could be energy efficient without being app-compatible or having a motion sensor—the information doesn’t force energy-efficient devices to have sensors. Option D is incorrect because Premise 3 only says devices without motion sensors aren’t app-compatible, but they could still be energy efficient some other way."

Option B is incorrect because the information doesn’t say every alarm system detects motion—only that motion detection leads to an alarm system. Option C is incorrect because Premise 3 says every system has video surveillance, so none lack it. Option D is incorrect because, while all systems integrate with smart devices (Premises 3 and 4), this isn’t directly tied to door sensors in the given premises."
